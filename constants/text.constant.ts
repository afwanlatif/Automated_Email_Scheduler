I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to express my interest in exploring new opportunities in backend development, particularly as a Node.js Developer. With over two years of experience working with Node.js, JavaScript, and TypeScript, I have built a strong foundation in developing scalable backend solutions and would love to connect with you regarding any potential opportunities, or insights you may have.

In my previous roles, I have had the opportunity to work with technologies such as JavaScript , TypeScript, Express.js, Hono.js, and databases including MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. I have developed and maintained RESTful APIs, worked with API documentation tools like SwaggerUI, and used testing frameworks such as Postman & Jest. Additionally, I am skilled in version control with GitHub and Bitbucket.

I would be extremely grateful for any guidance or suggestions you might have regarding potential roles or networks I could tap into. I believe your insights would be invaluable in helping me navigate the next steps in my career.

Please find my resume attached for your reference. I would be grateful for the opportunity to connect and would welcome any advice or opportunities you could share.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.       
 
Warm regards,
